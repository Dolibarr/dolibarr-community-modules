/**
 * \file    dev/tools/phpstan/bootstrap.php
 * \brief   Gives PHPStan the few Dolibarr constants a module resolves its includes against.
 * \remarks Read DOLIBARR_HTDOCS, the same variable the CI actions and the other tools of this
 *          repository use. This file deliberately does NOT load master.inc.php or main.inc.php:
 *          those open a database connection, start a session and read a conf.php that does not
 *          exist here, and PHPStan needs none of it. The classes and functions of the core reach
 *          the analysis through scanDirectories in phpstan.neon.dist, which indexes the symbols
 *          without running anything.

// version of the checkout under analysis would let PHPStan declare each of those guards dead code.
